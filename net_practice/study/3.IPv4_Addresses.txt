|     IPv4 Addresses: Format     |
\________________________________/

An IPv4 address has 32 bits, which is 4 bytes.

32 bits equals to 2³², which is 4,294,967,296 unique addresses.

Example: 01100010 10111100 00010011 01000111 -> This is an ip address in Binary
         \  98  / \ 188 / \  19  / \  71  / -> This is an ip address in Decimal
    
98.188.19.71 -> This is an ip address in Dot-Decimal

|     Network portion & Host portion     |
\________________________________________/

The first part in an IP address is always the network portion, and the second part is always the host portion.

    81 . 2 . 0 . 9
  network  | host
   portion |  portion

The octet can be split in many ways. The case above is a 10/22 split. The first octet is split in 10 bits for the network portion,
    and 22 bits for the host portion. This is only for /8, /16, /24 networks.



> But why whould we want to split an IP address into two parts?

                  |___________|

The server farm / small data center is a small network where we have six devices that require
    each one IP address at minimum.
Each of these 3 networks is connected to an interface on the router. This interface is going to
    be the default gateway for all of the devices that are inside the network.
The point of the network portion is to differentiate different networks. So, for the server farm, they associated ip's will
    have the similar values of "10.0.1." which is the network portion. The host part changes for each device.

The rule for the other routers is just the same, the network part will reside in the the first 3 numbers and the host part
    will be the last number.

The Network address is the very first IP address in a subnet. 
One of the gateways in the example above was assigned a value of 10.0.3.1. But this is not the first value in the network.
    The first value is 10.0.3.0.
Example: 81.2.255.255 -> the host portion is filled with 0's

The Broadcast address is the very last IP address in a subnet.
Example: 81.2.255.255 -> the host portion is filled with 1's

ROUTING TABLE: A routing table lists the different networks that this router can reach.
The routing table for R1 will be:
-8.0.0.0  -> i1

-10.0.1.0 -> i2 |
-10.0.2.0 -> i2 |-or->  10.0.0.0 -> i2

The routing table for R2 will be:
-8.0.0.0  -> i3
-9.0.0.0  -> i3
-10.0.1.0 -> i4
-10.0.2.0 -> i5
-10.0.3.0 -> i6

Class A - large networks

- Example: 71. 3. 99. 2

    |Network|  +---+--+---> Host

Network address:    71.0.0.0
Broadcast address:  71.255.255.255

Because the value is between 1-126, it is a Class A address.
________________________________________________________________

Class B - medium networks

- Example: 155.8.101.33

Network <---+--+  +--+--> Host

Network address:    155.8.0.0
Broadcast address:  155.8.255.255

Because the value is between 128-191, it is a Class B address.

- Example: 201.65.4.137
            |  |  |  |
Network <---+--+--+  +--> Host

Network address:    201.65.4.0
Broadcast address:  201.65.4.255

Because the value is between 192-223, it is a Class C address.

RFC 1918 defines three provate network ranges:
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918

- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12   ( 10101100.00010000.00000000.00000000 )
- 192.168.0.0/16  

There should be no devices on the Internet with these IP addresses.

1
Packet sent by 192.168.1.5 with destination 85.202.9.3
When the packet reaches the switch, the values remain the same.
When the packet reaches the LAN interface on the router, they still remain the same.
The values only change when the packet reaches the WAN (outside facing) interface on the router so,
    the source IP address is changed from the private IP address to the public IP address. 
    This is: 76.0.13.6
Then the packet is routed through the internet and when it finally reaches the http server, it only sees the public IP address.

2
Packet sent from http server 85.202.9.3 with destination 76.0.13.6
It basically makes the reverse way from the server to the router.
Only when it exits the router it changes the IP destination IP address to the computer that
    sent the packet to the server in first place, which is 192.168.1.5.
