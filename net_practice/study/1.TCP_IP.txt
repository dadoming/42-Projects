> TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) 

    It's a bunch of standardized rules that allow computers to communicate with each other over a network, such as the Internet.
    If they don't use this model, they might not send/receive data correctly and that can lead to disaster.
    So basically it's a set of rules that keeps the Internet usable in a data communication sense.
    <IP>  is the part that obtains the address to which data is sent.
    <TCP> is responsible for data delivery once the IP address has been found.
    "Think of it this way: The IP Address is like the phone number assigned to your smartphone. 
    The TCP is all the technology that makes the phone ring, and that enables you to talk to another phone."

    How TCP/IP sends data:
    If you were to send all the information at once and an error occurred, the whole message would be lost and would have to be resent.
    So instead, TCP/IP breaks the data into smaller pieces called packets.
    The packets are reassembled at the destination.
    The packets are also checked for errors and retransmitted if necessary.
    Packets can also take different routes to the destination, if the first round is unavailable or congestioned, which is called "routing".

    TCP/IP divides the different communication tasks into layers, each layer is responsible for a specific task.
    The data goes through the four layers before it is received on the other end and it then goes in reverse order to reassemble the data and 
        to present the recipient.
    The purpose of the layers is to make the communication process easier to understand and to keep things standardized. Just like so, 
        the software vendors can create products that will interact with other products without a problem. Just like car manufacturers,
        they all have the pedals in the same place.
    It also makes it easier to update each individual layer without having to update the whole system.

    This layer is the group of applications that require network communication. This is what the user typically interacts with, such as
        emails and messaging. Because the lower layers handle the details of communication, the applications don't have to worry about them.

|       TRANSPORT      |
\______________________/

    The transport layer is what provides a reliable data connection between two devices. It divides the data into packets, acknowledges
        the packets that is has received from the other device and makes sure the other device acknowledges the packets it receives. 
 ______________________
/                      \
|       NETWORK        |

    The network layer (also called Internet layer) is responsible for the control of the packet movement around the network.

|       PHYSICAL       |
\______________________/

    The physical layer (also called Link layer, Network Interface layer or Datalink layer) is what handles the physical parts of sending and
        receiving data using the Ethernet cable, wireless network, network interface, device driver in the computer, etc.


> Are data packets private?

    No. When the packets are being transmitted between computers, they are vulnerable to being seen by others. That's why you should avoid
        public Wi-Fi networks when sending data that must stay private, and to use encryption.
    To encrypt the data in those packets the use of a VPN (Virtual Private Network) is recommended.


> Types of IP addresses

    The differences between types of IP addresses are transparent to the casual user and are only important to network administrators.
    The different types of IP addresses are:
        -> Static IP address: It's a permanent IP address. It never changes. They are like fixed addresses on an house. Once a device has
            been assigned a static IP address, that number typically stays the same until the device has been decomissioned or the network
            archictecture changes. These addresses are generally used by servers and other important equipment. These can be either ipv4 
            or ipv6. Usually they are ipv4 tho.
        -> Dynamic IP address: These addresses change, or at least they are designed to change. They are assigned by DHCP (Dynamic Host
            Configuration Protocol) servers. These addresses are generally used by computers and other devices that are not always on the
            network. Whithin the home or business network, the Dynamic IP address is assigned by the router.

        -> Private IP address: An home router has a public IP address but also assigns a private IP address aka local IP address. 


IPv6: was developed as a solution to the IP Address shortage. Provides 3.4x10³⁸ addresses, which is approx. 340 trillion trillion trillion.
Example: 2001:0db8:3c4d:0012:0000:0000:1234:56ab
Another one: ::/0 -> Only has 0's in it. It is used for default routes.

IPv4: provides approx. 4.3 billion addresses.
Example: 192.168.1.12
